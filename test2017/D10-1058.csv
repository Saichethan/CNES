1,0,"A word in one language can be translated to zero, one, or several words in other languages."
2,1,Using word fertility features has been shown to be useful in building word alignment models for statistical machine translation.
3,2,We built a fertility hidden Markov model by adding fertility to the hidden Markov model.
4,3,"This model not only achieves lower alignment error rate than the hidden Markov model, but also runs faster."
5,4,"It is similar in some ways to IBM Model 4, but is much easier to understand."
6,5,"We use Gibbs sampling for parameter estimation, which is more principled than the neighborhood method used in IBM Model 4."
7,6,"IBM models and the hidden Markov model (HMM) for word alignment are the most influential statistical word alignment models (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel et al., 1996; Och and Ney, 2003)."
8,7,"There are three kinds of important information for word alignment models: lexicality, locality and fertility."
9,8,"IBM Model 1 uses only lexical information; IBM Model 2 and the hidden Markov model take advantage of both lexical and locality information; IBM Models 4 and 5 use all three kinds of information, and they remain the state of the art despite the fact that they were developed almost two decades ago."
10,9,Recent experiments on large datasets have shown that the performance of the hidden Markov model is very close to IBM Model 4.
11,10,"Nevertheless, we believe that IBM Model 4 is essentially a better model because it exploits the fertility of words in the tar get language."
12,11,"However, IBM Model 4 is so complex that most researches use the GIZA++ software package (Och and Ney, 2003), and IBM Model 4 itself is treated as a black box."
13,12,The complexity in IBM Model 4 makes it hard to understand and to improve.
14,13,"Our goal is to build a model that includes lexicality, locality, and fertility; and, at the same time, to make it easy to understand."
15,14,We also want it to be accurate and computationally efficient.
16,15,There have been many years of research on word alignment.
17,16,Our work is different from others in essential ways.
18,17,"Most other researchers take either the HMM alignments (Liang et al., 2006) or IBM Model 4 alignments (Cherry and Lin, 2003) as input and perform post-processing, whereas our model is a potential replacement for the HMM and IBM Model 4."
19,18,Directly modeling fertility makes our model fundamentally different from others.
20,19,Most models have limited ability to model fertility.
21,20,Liang et al.
22,21,"(2006) learn the alignment in both translation directions jointly, essentially pushing the fertility towards 1."
23,22,"ITG models (Wu, 1997) assume the fertility to be either zero or one."
24,23,"It can model phrases, but the phrase has to be contiguous."
25,24,"There have been works that try to simulate fertility using the hidden Markov model (Toutanova et al., 2002; Deng and Byrne, 2005), but we prefer to model fertility directly."
26,25,Our model is a coherent generative model that combines the HMM and IBM Model 4.
27,26,It is easier to understand than IBM Model 4 (see Section 3).
28,27,Our model also removes several undesired properties in IBM Model 4.
29,28,"We use Gibbs sampling instead of a heuristic-based neighborhood method for parameter 596 Proceedings of the 2010 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 596–605, MIT, Massachusetts, USA, 911 October 2010."

31,30,"Our distortion parameters are similar to IBM Model 2 and the HMM, while IBM Model 4 uses inverse distortion (Brown et al., 1993)."
32,31,"Our model assumes that fertility follows a Poisson distribution, while IBM Model 4 assumes a multinomial distribution, and has to learn a much larger number of parameters, which makes it slower and less reliable."
33,32,Our model is much faster than IBM Model 4.
34,33,"In fact, we will show that it is also faster than the HMM, and has lower alignment error rate than the HMM."
35,34,Parameter estimation for word alignment models that model fertility is more difficult than for models without fertility.
36,35,Brown et al.
37,36,"(1993) and Och and Ney (2003) first compute the Viterbi alignments for simpler models, then consider only some neighbors of the Viterbi alignments for modeling fertility."
38,37,"If the optimal alignment is not in those neighbors, this method will not be able find the opti total of I + 1 empty words for the HMM model1."
39,38,Moore (2004) also suggested adding multiple empty words to the target sentence for IBM Model 1.
40,39,"After we add I + 1 empty words to the target sentence, the alignment is a mapping from source to target word positions: a : j → i, i = aj where j = 1, 2, . . ."
41,40,", J and i = 1, 2, . . ."
42,41,", 2I + 1."
43,42,Words from position I + 1 to 2I + 1 in the target sentence are all empty words.
44,43,"We allow each source word to align with exactly one target word, but each target word may align with multiple source words."
45,44,The fertility φi of a word ei at position i is defined as the number of aligned source words: J mal alignment.
46,45,"We use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for training and decoding, φi = j=1 δ(aj , i) which has nice probabilistic guarantees."
47,46,DeNero et al.
48,47,(2008) applied the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to word alignment for machine translation; they do not model word fertility.

55,54,"get sentence are a set Bi, such that each element in Bi is aligned with i, and all alignments of i are in Bi."

59,58,"For convenience, we add an empty word ǫ to the target sentence at position 0 (i.e., e0 = ǫ)."
60,59,"However, as we will see, we have to add more than one empty word for the HMM."
61,60,2.2 IBM Model 1 and HMM.
62,61,"IBM Model 1 and the HMM are both generative models, and both start by defining the probability of alignments and source sentence given the In order to compute the “jump probability” in the target sentence: P (aJJ 1 ); the data likeli HMM model, we need to know the position of the 1 , f1 |e2I +1 hood can be computed by summing over alignments: aligned target word for the previous source word."
63,62,"If the previous source word aligns to an empty word, 1 If fj."
64,63,"−1 does not align with an empty word and fj alignswe could use the position of the empty word to indi with an empty word, we want to record the position of the target word that fj−1 aligns with."
65,64,There are I + 1 possibilities: fj is cate the nearest previous source word that does not align to an empty word.
66,65,"For this reason, we use a the first word in the source sentence, or fj the target word."
67,66,"−1 aligns with one ofP (f J |e2I +1) = ""£ J P (aJ , f J |e2I +1)."
68,67,The alignwhere the first two equations imply that the proba 1 1 a1 1 1 1 ments aJ are the hidden variables.
69,68,The expectation maximization algorithm is used to learn the parameters such that the data likelihood is maximized.
70,69,"Without loss of generality, P (aJ , f J |e2I +1) can bility of jumping to an empty word is either 0 or p0, and the third equation implies that the probability of jumping from a nonempty word is the same as the probability of jumping from the corespondent empty 1 1 1 be decomposed into length probabilities, distortion probabilities (also called alignment probabilities), and lexical probabilities (also called translation probabilities): P (aJ , f J |e2I +1) 1 1 1 J word."
71,70,"The absolute position in the HMM is not important, because we re-parametrize the distortion probability in terms of the distance between adjacent alignment points (Vogel et al., 1996; Och and Ney, 2003): = P (J |e2I +1) n P (aj , fj |f j−1, aj−1, e2I +1) c(i − i′) 1 j=1 1 1 1 P (i|i′, I ) = ""£ i′′ c(i′′ − i′) J = P (J |e2I +1) n P (aj |f j−1, aj−1, e2I +1) × where c( ) is the count of jumps of a given distance."
72,71,"1 j=1 1 1 1 In IBM Model 1, the word order does not mat ter."

76,75,"In practice, the fertility for a target word in IBM Model 1 is not very big except for rare target words, which can become a garbage collector, and align to many source words (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2003; Moore, 2004)."
77,76,"The HMM is P (aJ , f J |e2I +1) = P (J |I ) n P (f |e ) less likely to have this garbage collector problem be 1 1 1 (2I + 1)J j=1 j aj cause of the alignment probability constraint."
78,77,"However, fertility is an inherent cross language propertyThe hidden Markov model assumes a length prob ability that depends only on the length of the target sentence, a distortion probability that depends only on the previous alignment and the length of the target sentence, and a lexical probability that depends only on the aligned target word: P (aJ , f J |e2I +1) = 1 1 1 J P (J |I ) n P (aj |aj−1, I )P (fj |ea ) j=1 In order to make the HMM work correctly, we enforce the following constraints (Och and Ney, 2003): and these two models cannot assign consistent fertility to words."
79,78,"This is our motivation for adding fertility to these two models, and we expect that the resulting models will perform better than the baseline models."
80,79,"Because the HMM performs much better than IBM Model 1, we expect that the fertility hidden Markov model will perform much better than the fertility IBM Model 1."
81,80,"Throughout the paper, “our model” refers to the fertility hidden Markov model."
82,81,"Due to space constraints, we are unable to provide details for IBM Models 3, 4 and 5; see Brown et al."
83,82,(1993) and Och and Ney (2003).
84,83,"But we want to point out that the locality property modeled in the HMM is missing in IBM Model 3, and is modeled invertedly in IBM Model 4."
85,84,"IBM Model 5 removes deficiency (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2003) from IBM Model 4, but it is computationally very expensive due to the larger number of parameters than IBM Model 4, and IBM Model 5 often provides no improvement on alignment accuracy."
86,85,"Our fertility IBM Model 1 and fertility HMM are both generative models and start by defining the probability of fertilities (for each nonempty target word and all empty words), alignments, and the source sentence given the target sentence: P (φI , φǫ, aJ , f J |e2I +1); 1 1 1 1 are further away from the mean have low probability."
87,86,"IBM Models 3, 4, and 5 use a multinomial distribution for fertility, which has a much larger number of parameters to learn."
88,87,"Our model has only one parameter for each target word, which can be learned more reliably."
89,88,"In the fertility IBM Model 1, we assume that the distortion probability is uniform, and the lexical probability depends only on the aligned target word: P (φI , φǫ, aJ , f J |e2I +1) the data likelihood can be computed by 1 1 1 I φi 1 λ(ei ) summing over fertilities and alignments: n λ(ei) e− × P (f J |e2I +1) = ""£ I J P (φI , φǫ, aJ , f J |e2I +1)."

131,130,"Interestingly, we found that throwing away the fertility and using the HMM Viterbi decoding achieves same results as the sampling approach (we can ignore the difference because it is tiny), but is faster."

160,159,We evaluate our fertility models on a ChineseEnglish corpus.
161,160,"The ChineseEnglish data taken from FBIS newswire data, and has 380K sentence pairs, and we use the first 100K sentence pairs as our training data."
162,161,We used hand-aligned data as reference.
163,162,The ChineseEnglish data has 491 sentence pairs.
164,163,We initialize IBM Model 1 and the fertility IBM Model 1 with a uniform distribution.
165,164,"We smooth all parameters (λ(e) and P (f |e)) by adding a small value (10−8), so they never become too small."
166,165,We run both models for 5 iterations.
167,166,"AER results are computed using the IBM Model 1 Viterbi alignments, and the Viterbi alignments obtained from the Gibbs sampling algorithm."
168,167,We initialize the HMM and the fertility HMM with the parameters learned in the 5th iteration of IBM Model 1.
169,168,"We smooth all parameters (λ(e), P (a|a′) and P (f |e)) by adding a small value (10−8)."
170,169,We run both models for 5 iterations.
171,170,AER results are computed using traditional HMM Viterbi decoding for both models.
172,171,It is always difficult to determine how many samples are enough for sampling algorithms.
173,172,"However, both fertility models achieve better results than their baseline models using a small amount of samples."
174,173,"For the fertility IBM Model 1, we sample 10 times for each aj , and restart 3 times in the training stage; we sample 100 times and restart 12 times in the testing stage."
175,174,"For the fertility HMM, we sample 30 times for each aj with no restarting in the training stage; no sampling in the testing stage because we use traditional HMM Viterbi decoding for testing."
176,175,More samples give no further improvement.
177,176,"Initially, the fertility IBM Model 1 and fertility HMM did not perform well."
178,177,"If a target word e only appeared a few times in the training corpus, our model cannot reliably estimate the parameter λ(e)."
179,178,"Hence, smoothing is needed."
180,179,One may try to solve it by forcing all these words to share a same parameter λ(einfrequent).
181,180,"Unfortunately, this does not solve the problem because all infrequent words tend to have larger fertility than they should."
182,181,"We solve the problem in the following way: estimate the parameter λ(enon empty ) for all nonempty words, all infrequent words share this parameter."
183,182,We consider words that appear less than 10 times as infrequent words.
184,183,"Table 1, Figure 1, and Figure 2 shows the AER results for different models."
185,184,"We can see that the fertility IBM Model 1 consistently outperforms IBM Model 1, and the fertility HMM consistently outperforms the HMM."
186,185,"The fertility HMM not only has lower AER than the HMM, it also runs faster than the HMM."
187,186,Figure 3 show the training time for different models.
188,187,"In fact, with just 1 sample for each alignment, our model archives lower AER than the HMM, and runs more than 5 times faster than the HMM."
189,188,It is possible to use sampling instead of dynamic programming in the HMM to reduce the training time with no decrease in AER (often an increase).
190,189,"We conclude that the fertility HMM not only has better AER results, but also runs faster than the hidden Markov model."
191,190,"We also evaluate our model by computing the machine translation BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) using the Moses system (Koehn et al., 2007)."
192,191,"The training data is the same as the above word alignment evaluation bitexts, with alignments for each model symmetrized using the grow-diag-final heuristic."
193,192,"Our test is 633 sentences of up to length 50, with four references."
194,193,Results are shown in Table 2; we see that better word alignment results do not lead to better translations.

196,195,We developed a fertility hidden Markov model that runs faster and has lower AER than the HMM.
197,196,Our model is thus much faster than IBM Model 4.
198,197,Our model is also easier to understand than IBM Model 4.
199,198,The Markov Chain Monte Carlo method used in our model is more principled than the heuristic-based neighborhood method in IBM Model 4.
200,199,"While better word alignment results do not necessarily correspond to better translation quality, our translation results are comparable in translation quality to both the HMM and IBM Model 4."
